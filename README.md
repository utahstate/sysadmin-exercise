# sysadmin-exercise: Docker Setup

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have:

- A virtual machine (VM) with your desired operating system installed.  You should be able to use Windows or Linux.
- Use the virtualization software of your choice (i.e. VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU, Parallels, etc.)
- This Docker image will only run in a virtual machine.

## Instructions

We were given the Dockerfile in this repo and were instructed that there should be a webapp that spawns when the Docker container is running.

Build an image using this Dockerfile and investigate the webapp.
   
## Presentation and Interview Day

Be prepared to walk us through the methods you used to build the virtual machine and docker image and how you went about investigating the application.
